		     INSTANCE VARIABLE
		1) Instance variables are declared in a ...CLASS..., 
           but outside ....METHOD... , ...CONSTRUCTORS...
        2) Instance variables are attached to an ...OBJECTS.......;  
           therefore, they are created when an ...OBJECT....... is  
           created and destroyed when the ...OBJECT....... is  
           destroyed.
        3) Instance variables can be accessed by  
           calling with the ...OBJECT....... name.
        4) Initialization of instance variable is not  
            .....?...... If it is not initialized it will have a  
            default value
        5) Every time, you will have the initialize value 
           of an instance variable when you create a new  
           object. True / False ==>FALSE ==> DEFAULT VALUE
        6) If you created 6 objects by using a class  
           which has two instance variables, it means  
           you created 12 instance variables  True / False  ==>TRUE
           
              STATIC VARIABLE
        1) Static variables are declared in a ...CLASS.......,  
           but outside ...METHODS... , ...CONSTRUCTORS...
        2) Static variables are attached to a ....CLASS......;  
           therefore, they are created when a ...CLASS....... is  
           created and destroyed when the .....CLASS..... is  
           destroyed.
        3) Static variables can be accessed by  
           calling with the ....CLASS...... name.
        4) Initialization of static variable is not

           default value
        5) Every time, you will have the initialize value 
           of a static variable when you create a new  
           class. True / False  ==> FALSE ==>DEFAULT VALUE
        6) If you created 6 objects by using a class  
           which has two static variables, it means  
           you created just 2 static variables.  True / False  ==> TRUE
